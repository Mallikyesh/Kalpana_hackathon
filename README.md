## SMART PHARMA: A Hackathon Project for Faster Pharmacy Refills

**SMART PHARMA** is a prototype system designed to improve the pharmacy experience for regular patients with chronic conditions who require frequent medication refills. It aims to reduce wait times, minimize errors, and enhance convenience through automation and secure data management.

**Problem:** 

Traditional pharmacy refill processes can be time-consuming and frustrating for both patients and pharmacists. Patients often face long wait times, medication confusion, and limited refill options. Pharmacies struggle with maintaining efficient inventory management and ensuring fast retrieval for a large number of patients.

**Solution:**

SMART PHARMA tackles these issues by leveraging the following technologies:

* **Encrypted cloud database:** Securely stores prescriptions and patient medical history, accessible only by patients and their doctors.
* **Facial recognition:** Regular patients can opt-in to facial recognition for quick identification at the pharmacy kiosk.
* **LED-guided retrieval:** The kiosk highlights the specific medications a patient needs, simplifying the retrieval process.
* **Pre-order and inventory management:** Pharmacies can anticipate patient needs and optimize medication stock based on data analysis.
* **Mobile app (optional):** Patients can manage prescriptions and potentially receive medication reminders through a user-friendly app.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced wait times:** Patients can quickly retrieve their medications without waiting in line.
* **Minimized errors:** Facial recognition and LED-guided retrieval reduce the possibility of incorrect medications being dispensed.
* **Improved inventory control:** Pharmacies can maintain optimal stock levels by anticipating patient needs.
* **Enhanced convenience:** Overall pharmacy experience is streamlined for patients with frequent refills.

**This project was developed during a 24-hour hackathon.**  The codebase demonstrates the initial prototype and serves as a foundation for further development.
